# Introduction to Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This lesson is designed for Software Carpentry users who have completed [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) and are looking to jump straight into image classification. We recognize that this jump is quite large and have done our best to provide the content and code to perform these types of analyses.

Note the first episode runs through all of the steps necessary to perform an image classification in order to get participants excited about the topic. By design this episode leaves out a lot of detail and will spark a lot of questions. We follow this introductory episode with an episode on how python sees images as this topic is not covered in PPP. The remaining episodes return to the steps glossed over in the introduction and take a closer look at each in more detail.
